Automated generation of the wrapper around riffa2ahir interface and 
ahir_system.vhdl to interact with ports provided 
by riffa on a channel.

Inputs -	no. of channels
		names of i/p & o/p pipes on those channels
		length of output data on each channel

Output -	verilog file with top module named chnl_tester  (name could be changed)
		port declaration and instantiation of riffa2ahir and ahir_system 
		modules is done by script.
		Uses templates that have driectives to be replaced by meaningful hdl


Done with declaring output lengths and instantiation of 
separate riffa2ahir interfaces on each channel.

### Bug fixed : was earlier replacing the chnl_index directive by 0
		in riffa2ahir interface in first instantiation.
		From next_onwards, there was no directive and 0 appeared
		everywhere. 
		Fixed using a temporary line storing the $- so that actual
		template data is not changed.
